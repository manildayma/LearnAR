# AUGMENTED REALITY

Augmented reality (AR) is a type of interactive, reality-based display environment that takes the capabilities of 
computer generated display, sound, text and effects to enhance the user's real-world experience. 

Simply, Virtual World + Real World = Augmented Reality

Augmented reality has emance power and potential which can be used to solve many real life problems. 
The sole aim of this project is to solve to such problems, that is...

# Augmented Reality Based Learning Application

## Applications/Use Cases :
### Students : 
Students can learn with interactive models which can be brought into reality with the help of AR. They can not only see but also interact with models. For engineering and mechanical students itâ€™s difficult to study about the functioning and parts of machines.  For medical students, it is very hard to understand about body, bones and muscles. All they are shows in 2D diagrams or videos but with the help of AR they can view 3D models in their environment itself from any possible angle and analyse it at their level.

### Industries :
Working of various large machines can be shown to new employees instead of just showing the model of the machine.
This can be solved which the help of AR which can help them to give important insights about the working of the machine.
Prototypes are made before constructing any large building or any other infrastructure. To reduce this cost, model of
AR can be used to view how infrastructure will look like and what all possible defects are there.
